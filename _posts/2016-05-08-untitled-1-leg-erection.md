# Untitled Perishable Lightning Rod

Genu - 2016

Ghirdoveni Art Installation

Ludic and Oneiric interpretation of a high raise inhabited building. I imagine here the mix of fear and excitement. Fear of structural soundness against the joy and excitement of inhabiting an architectural skyscraper. Thus, I call this mixed feeling "Untitled Perishable Lightning Rod", this being one of my artistic studies about Space-Time-Conscience relations and Perishable States of Matter and Mind in the context of Life synergy.
