# Genu Berlo

American - born Romanian - working in New York, Bucuresti and Ghirdoveni

In painting, installation, land art and sculpture I reflect on ideas such as Space and Time from a Pattern perspective, Expressions and Fractality of Body and Mind. The Pattern is Ritm, and is fundamental to all creative processes. A recurring theme in my work is also the relationship between language and space-time as basis of structure and resonance in mental and emotional fields. In exploring Awareness states, I like using patterns and images of ancient and archaic source. I also experiment with "**non-action painting**" which I call a state of mind and body, where form and color are not important, yet they are a direct result of this state, almost compulsive, and significant to self. I worked as a designer architect in New York City architectural firms, including Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Dan Ionescu Architects, Peix and Marchetti Architects, Mihai Radu Architects. Education: Continuing Education in Fine Arts - Fashion Institute of Technology of NYC 2003; Bachelors in Architecture - University of Bucharest 2001; Bachelors in Math - University of Bucharest 1997
