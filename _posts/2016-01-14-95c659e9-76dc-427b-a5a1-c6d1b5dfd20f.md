# Genu Berlo

American - born Romanian - working in New York, Bucuresti and Ghirdoveni

In painting, installation, land art and sculpture I reflect on ideas such as Magnetic Body Space Interaction, Awareness Field and Layers, Expressions and Fractality of Body and Mind, Architectural nesting of the Body. A recurring theme in my work is also the relationship between language and space, mental and physical. In exploring Awareness states, I like using patterns and images of ancient and archaic source. I also experiment with "**non-action painting**" which I call a state of mind and body similar to Zen, where form and color are not important, yet they are a direct result of this state, almost compulsive, and it is significant to self. I worked as a designer architect in New York City architectural firms, including Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Dan Ionescu Architects, Peix and Marchetti Architects, Mihai Radu Architects.

Education: Continuing Education in Fine Arts - Fashion Institute of Technology of NYC 2003; Bachelors in Architecture - University of Bucharest 2001; Bachelors in Math - University of Bucharest 1997
