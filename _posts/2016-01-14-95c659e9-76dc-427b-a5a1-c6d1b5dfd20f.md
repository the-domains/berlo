# Genu

American - born Romanian

In painting, installation, land art and sculpture Genu reflects on concepts like Bigger Purpose Fractality, Magnetic Interaction under Field Awareness, Space-Time-Conscience, Inception and Transformation of Amorphous into Sign and vice versa, Perishable States of Matter and Mind against Empowering Works of Light, Long Life Formulas. His crossdomain educational backgrounds are of strong influence when it comes to designing structures and spaces embedded with Value Inheritance and Golden Mean Geometric Principles, using artistic and architectural means and processes.

With Bachelors in Math and Architecture from the University of Bucharest, Genu (Eugen) Berlo continued his education in Fine Arts at Fashion Institute of Technology of NYC. He worked as an architect for some of the New York City's most eminent architectural firms, including world's highly renowned Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) architectural, planning and engineering company.
