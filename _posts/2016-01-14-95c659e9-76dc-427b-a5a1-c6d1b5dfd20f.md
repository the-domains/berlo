**BerloAtelier **

_Value Inheritance_

Established by Eugen Berlo in 2007, [BerloAtelier][0] is a crossdomain venture dedicated to explore and work within a Bigger Purpose and Field Conscience using artistic and architectural means and processes, with active projects in private and public inhabited spaces. Our master believe is that a great project have **Value Inheritance **- which we define as strong aesthetics, human scale functionality, and intelligent meaning clad onto its core vision. We enter each project with a Design Intention, and push for simplicity and innovation, with respect for environment, and site cultural and material values. With almost each project we enjoy taking an integrated design route, and establish relationships that can build and develop future grounds.

**Eugen Bogdan Berlo **

Principal Eugen Berlo is architect, designer and developer. With Bachelors in Math and Architecture from the University of Bucharest, he continued his education in Fine Arts at Fashion Institute of Technology of NYC.
