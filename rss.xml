            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Established by Eugen Berlo in 2007, BerloAtelier is a crossdomain venture dedicated to explore and work a “Bigger Purpose” in art, architecture and public spaces, by artistic and architectural means and processes. </h1><p>Our master believe is that great projects have strong aesthetic, functional and social ideas clad onto a core vision derived from a “Bigger Purpose”, and engaged by both the client and maker. We enter each project with a Design Intention, and push for simplicity and innovation. All with respect for environment, and site cultural and material values. With each project we like to take the integrated design route, and establish relationships that can build and develop future grounds.</p></article>]]></description>
